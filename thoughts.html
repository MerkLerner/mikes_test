	<h2>Rhythm - the musical application of surprise</h2>
	<p>
		I've been drumming for years, but it's only recently that I've felt like I had language for the different ways rhythms feel. Sure, it's been easy to say that a tempo felt energetic or slow, or that a rhythm felt busier or emptiery or funkier or what have you. But the specific feeling of say, the last sixtheenth note in a beat has a certain leaning feel to it - it anticipates the downbeat.
